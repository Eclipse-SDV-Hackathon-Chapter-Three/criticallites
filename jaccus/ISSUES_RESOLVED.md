# JACCUS Issues Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ ACC Mode Disabling Problem
**Problem**: Could not properly disable ACC mode
**Solution**:
- Added `emergency_disable()` method for immediate ACC shutdown
- ESC key now emergency disables ACC/Autonomous modes
- Manual brake (S key) immediately disables ACC entirely
- Manual throttle (W key) releases emergency brake and allows control resumption

### 2. ‚úÖ Emergency Brake Too Harsh
**Problem**: Emergency brake was too aggressive and triggered on lane lines
**Solution**:
- **Reduced sensitivity**: Base distance reduced from 8m to 3m
- **Progressive braking**: Instead of 100% brake, now uses 30-100% based on distance
- **Cooldown system**: 1-second cooldown prevents constant emergency braking
- **Filtered collision detection**: Excludes lane markings, only triggers on real obstacles (vehicles, pedestrians, static objects)
- **Manual override**: Manual throttle (W key) immediately releases emergency brake

### 3. ‚úÖ Priority on `automatic_control_zenoh.py` Integration
**Problem**: Needed exact BehaviorAgent behavior from automatic_control_zenoh.py
**Solution**:
- **Direct code copying**: Used exact BehaviorAgent initialization pattern
- **Same destination logic**: Identical random destination setting using spawn points
- **Pure agent control**: In autonomous mode, agent.run_step() provides complete control
- **Simplified logic**: Removed complex overrides, focusing on direct agent control

## Enhanced Features

### üéØ **Three-Mode System**
1. **Manual Control**: Complete driver control
2. **ACC (Speed Control)**: Speed management + obstacle avoidance (manual steering)
3. **Full Autonomous**: Complete BehaviorAgent control (same as automatic_control_zenoh.py)

### üîë **Key Controls**
- **J Key**: Cycle through modes (Manual ‚Üí ACC ‚Üí Autonomous ‚Üí Manual)
- **ESC Key**: Emergency disable (immediate return to manual)
- **S/Down**: Manual brake (disables ACC entirely)
- **W/Up**: Manual throttle (overrides emergency brake, resumes control)
- **A/D**: Manual steering (disables autonomous, keeps ACC)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**
- **Emergency disable**: Multiple ways to return to manual control
- **Progressive braking**: Gentler, distance-based brake force
- **Collision filtering**: Only real obstacles trigger emergency brake
- **Manual override**: Any manual input takes precedence
- **Cooldown system**: Prevents brake oscillation

## Technical Implementation

### Emergency Braking Algorithm (Improved)
```python
# Less aggressive distance calculation
base_distance = 3.0m (reduced from 8.0m)
speed_factor = 0.2 (reduced from 0.3)
brake_force = 30-100% (progressive, not always 100%)
cooldown = 1.0 second (prevents constant braking)
```

### BehaviorAgent Integration (Direct Copy)
```python
# Exact same as automatic_control_zenoh.py
agent = BehaviorAgent(vehicle, behavior="normal")
agent.set_target_speed(target_speed / 3.6)  # km/h to m/s
destination = random.choice(spawn_points).location
agent.set_destination(destination)
control = agent.run_step(debug=False)  # Main control logic
```

### Manual Override Logic
```python
# Manual throttle releases emergency brake
if manual_throttle_pressed:
    emergency_brake_active = False
    resume_control()

# Manual brake disables ACC entirely
if manual_brake_pressed:
    acc.emergency_disable()

# Manual steering disables autonomous but keeps ACC
if manual_steering:
    autonomous_mode = False  # Keep ACC for speed control
```

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**
- ACC can be disabled via multiple methods (ESC, manual brake, S key)
- Emergency brake is gentler and less sensitive
- No more triggering on lane lines
- Manual override works immediately
- BehaviorAgent integration follows exact automatic_control_zenoh.py pattern

### üöÄ **Working Features**
- Three-mode cycling with J key
- MQTT integration for remote control
- Progressive emergency braking
- Collision detection (vehicles/pedestrians only)
- Fallback mode when CARLA agents unavailable
- Clean resource management

### üéÆ **User Experience**
- Clear HUD notifications for mode changes
- Immediate manual override capability
- Emergency escape routes (ESC, manual brake)
- Progressive safety systems (not harsh cutoffs)
- Console logging for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Mode Cycling Test**
```bash
cd /home/seame/criticallites/jaccus
just run-jaccus
# Press J to cycle: Manual ‚Üí ACC ‚Üí Autonomous ‚Üí Manual
```

### 2. **ACC Disabling Test**
```bash
# Enable ACC (press J once)
# Try these methods to disable:
# - Press S (brake) - should disable ACC immediately
# - Press ESC - should emergency disable
# - Press J twice more - should cycle back to manual
```

### 3. **Emergency Brake Override Test**
```bash
# Get close to obstacle in ACC/Autonomous mode
# Emergency brake should engage gently (30-100% progressive)
# Press W (throttle) - should release brake and resume control
# Should not trigger on lane markings anymore
```

### 4. **Manual Override Test**
```bash
# In Autonomous mode, try manual inputs:
# - A/D steering: Should disable autonomous, keep ACC
# - S brake: Should disable everything, return to manual
# - W throttle: Should release any emergency brake
```

## Configuration Adjustments

Key parameters that were adjusted in `config.py`:

```python
# Less aggressive emergency braking
EMERGENCY_BRAKE_BASE_DISTANCE = 3.0      # Reduced from 8.0
EMERGENCY_BRAKE_SPEED_FACTOR = 0.2       # Reduced from 0.3
EMERGENCY_BRAKE_COLLISION_TIME_THRESHOLD = 2.0  # Added cooldown

# Autonomous mode (same as automatic_control_zenoh.py)
AUTONOMOUS_DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR = "normal"
AUTONOMOUS_TARGET_SPEED = 50.0
AUTONOMOUS_FOLLOW_SPEED_LIMITS = True
```

## Summary

All three issues have been resolved:

1. **‚úÖ ACC disabling**: Multiple reliable methods (ESC, manual brake, S key)
2. **‚úÖ Emergency brake harshness**: Progressive, filtered, with manual override
3. **‚úÖ Priority on automatic_control_zenoh.py**: Direct BehaviorAgent integration

The system now provides the exact autonomous behavior from `automatic_control_zenoh.py` while maintaining safe, user-friendly controls and less aggressive emergency systems.
