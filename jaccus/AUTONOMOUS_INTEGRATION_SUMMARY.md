# JACCUS Autonomous Driving Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated full autonomous driving capabilities from `just run-automatic` into `just run-jaccus` via the J key toggle mechanism. The system now supports three distinct control modes with seamless transitions.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Control Modes

The J key now cycles through three modes:
1. **Manual Control** - Direct driver input
2. **ACC (Speed Control)** - Adaptive cruise control maintaining target speed while avoiding obstacles
3. **Full Autonomous Mode** - Complete BehaviorAgent control with pathfinding and navigation

### Key Components Modified

#### 1. Adaptive Cruise Control (`adaptive_cruise_control.py`)
- **Enhanced Class Structure**: Added autonomous mode support with BehaviorAgent integration
- **Three-State Toggle**: Implemented manual ‚Üí ACC ‚Üí autonomous ‚Üí manual cycling
- **Emergency Braking**: Dynamic distance calculation based on speed and collision prediction
- **Collision Detection**: Integrated collision sensor monitoring with history tracking
- **Resource Management**: Clean initialization and cleanup of BehaviorAgent instances

#### 2. Keyboard Handler (`keyboard_handler.py`)
- **Enhanced J Key**: Improved feedback showing current mode (Manual/ACC/Autonomous)
- **Mode Notifications**: Clear HUD notifications and console logging for mode transitions
- **BehaviorAgent Status**: Display agent type and operational status

#### 3. Configuration (`config.py`)
- **Autonomous Settings**: Added comprehensive configuration for BehaviorAgent behavior
- **Emergency Braking**: Configurable distance calculations and brake force parameters
- **Safety Parameters**: Collision thresholds, steering limits, and operational boundaries

### Technical Integration

#### BehaviorAgent Integration Pattern
```python
# Reused exact logic from automatic_control_zenoh.py
from agents.navigation.behavior_agent import BehaviorAgent

# Agent initialization (lines 740-790 pattern)
self.agent = BehaviorAgent(vehicle, behavior=behavior_type)
destination = carla.Location(x=target_x, y=target_y, z=target_z)
self.agent.set_destination(destination)

# Control loop integration
control = self.agent.run_step(debug=True)
```

#### Emergency Braking Algorithm
```python
def calculate_emergency_brake_distance(speed_kmh):
    """Dynamic braking distance based on speed"""
    base_distance = Config.EMERGENCY_BRAKE_BASE_DISTANCE  # 5.0m
    speed_factor = Config.EMERGENCY_BRAKE_SPEED_FACTOR   # 0.3s
    return base_distance + (speed_kmh / 3.6) * speed_factor
```

#### Collision Detection Integration
- Monitors front-facing collision sensors
- Tracks collision history for trend analysis
- Calculates time-to-collision for emergency braking
- Integrates with World class sensor infrastructure

### Safety Features

#### 1. Emergency Braking System
- **Speed-Dependent Distance**: Minimum stopping distance increases with speed
- **Collision Prediction**: Time-to-collision calculations for proactive braking
- **Force Modulation**: Progressive braking based on threat level
- **Override Capability**: Manual control always takes precedence

#### 2. State Management
- **Clean Transitions**: Proper resource cleanup when switching modes
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when BehaviorAgent unavailable
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback to manual control on errors

#### 3. User Feedback
- **HUD Integration**: Clear mode indicators and status displays
- **Console Logging**: Detailed operational logs for debugging
- **Notification System**: Real-time alerts for mode changes and issues

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented
- Three-mode toggle system (Manual/ACC/Autonomous)
- BehaviorAgent integration pattern from automatic_control_zenoh.py
- Emergency braking with dynamic distance calculation
- Collision detection and history tracking
- Enhanced keyboard handler with mode feedback
- Comprehensive configuration system
- Fallback mode support when CARLA agents unavailable

### üîÑ Operational Status
- System runs successfully in fallback mode
- MQTT client integration working
- Mode switching functional with proper notifications
- Configuration system fully operational

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies Required
- CARLA PythonAPI for full BehaviorAgent functionality
- Zenoh client configuration needs adjustment for proper routing
- Full testing requires CARLA simulator running

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Mode Testing
```bash
cd /home/seame/criticallites/jaccus
just run-jaccus
```

### 2. Mode Cycling Test
- Press `J` to cycle through modes
- Observe HUD notifications showing current mode
- Check console output for detailed status
- Verify smooth transitions between modes

### 3. Emergency Braking Test
- Enable ACC or Autonomous mode
- Approach obstacles or vehicles
- Observe automatic braking behavior
- Test manual override capability

### 4. Full Autonomous Test (requires CARLA)
- Ensure CARLA simulator running
- Start JACCUS with proper CARLA connection
- Press `J` twice to reach Autonomous mode
- Observe BehaviorAgent pathfinding and navigation

### 5. MQTT Integration Test
```bash
# Send speed command via MQTT
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "vehicle/commands" -m '{"command":"speed","value":45}'

# Send cruise control toggle
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "vehicle/commands" -m '{"command":"cruise_control","value":true}'
```

## Configuration Options

### Autonomous Behavior Settings
```python
AUTONOMOUS_DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR = "normal"      # BehaviorAgent behavior type
AUTONOMOUS_TARGET_SPEED = 50.0             # km/h default speed
AUTONOMOUS_FOLLOW_SPEED_LIMITS = True      # Respect map speed limits
AUTONOMOUS_IGNORE_LIGHTS = False           # Traffic light compliance
AUTONOMOUS_USE_BBS_DETECTION = True        # Bounding box detection
```

### Emergency Braking Parameters
```python
EMERGENCY_BRAKE_BASE_DISTANCE = 5.0        # Base stopping distance
EMERGENCY_BRAKE_SPEED_FACTOR = 0.3         # Speed-dependent factor
EMERGENCY_BRAKE_MAX_FORCE = 1.0           # Maximum brake force
EMERGENCY_BRAKE_COLLISION_TIME_THRESHOLD = 2.0  # Time to collision
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Mode Descriptions
1. **Manual Control**: Full driver control, no automated systems active
2. **ACC Mode**: Speed control only - maintains target speed, avoids obstacles, but requires driver steering
3. **Autonomous Mode**: Full automated driving - BehaviorAgent handles steering, speed, and navigation

### Best Practices
- Always start in Manual mode for safety
- Use ACC mode for highway driving with manual steering
- Use Autonomous mode only in controlled environments
- Monitor system status via HUD notifications
- Keep emergency manual override ready

### Troubleshooting
- If BehaviorAgent unavailable, system automatically uses fallback mode
- MQTT errors don't affect core functionality
- Zenoh configuration issues don't prevent operation
- All mode switches are logged for debugging

## Integration Success

The implementation successfully integrates the autonomous driving capabilities from `automatic_control_zenoh.py` into the JACCUS framework while maintaining:

- ‚úÖ **Code Reuse**: Direct adoption of BehaviorAgent patterns
- ‚úÖ **Safety Integration**: Emergency braking and collision detection
- ‚úÖ **User Experience**: Intuitive J key toggle with clear feedback
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when dependencies missing
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Comprehensive settings for customization
- ‚úÖ **Resource Management**: Clean initialization and cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Clear usage instructions and technical details

The system is now ready for testing and further refinement based on operational experience.
