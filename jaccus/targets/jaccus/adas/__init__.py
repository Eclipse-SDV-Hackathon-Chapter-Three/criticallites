Key Features:
    - Speed control with configurable PID parameters
    - Obstacle detection and emergency braking
    - Road boundary violation detection (sidewalk prevention)
    - CARLA agent integration for autonomous navigation
    - Comprehensive logging and telemetry integration

Safety Systems:
    - Multi-distance sidewalk detection (2m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 12m ahead)
    - Lane type analysis for prohibited area detection
    - Emergency brake override with immediate vehicle stop
    - Thread-safe logging with GIL state management
