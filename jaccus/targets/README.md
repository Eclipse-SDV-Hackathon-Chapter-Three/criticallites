# Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to `jaccus.py` to implement adaptive cruise control functionality.

## Overview

The adaptive cruise control (ACC) system has been added to the CARLA manual control client. The system automatically maintains a target speed while detecting obstacles ahead and applying smooth braking when necessary.

## Key Features Added

### 1. **Keyboard Control**
- **J Key**: Toggle ACC on/off
- **+/- Keys**: Adjust target speed when ACC is active (±5 km/h increments)
- **S Key (Brake)**: Manually disable ACC when pressed

### 2. **Automatic Speed Control**
- Maintains user-defined target speed (default: current speed when activated)
- Minimum target speed: 20 km/h
- Maximum target speed: 120 km/h
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration

### 3. **Obstacle Detection and Automatic Braking**
- Uses existing `ObstacleDetectionSensor` data
- Fallback to manual vehicle detection using CARLA world actors
- Forward-facing detection cone (45-degree angle)
- Detection range: up to 50 meters

### 4. **Intelligent Braking System**
- **Emergency braking** (distance < 10m): Strong brake force (0.4-1.0)
- **Gradual braking** (distance < 20m): Moderate brake force (0.0-0.6)
- **Speed regulation**: Gentle braking/acceleration to maintain target speed
- Visual feedback for emergency situations

### 5. **HUD Integration**
- Real-time ACC status display
- Target speed indication
- Current brake factor display
- Visual notifications for state changes

## Implementation Details

### State Variables Added
```python
self._acc_enabled = False              # ACC on/off state
self._acc_target_speed = 50.0          # Target speed in km/h
self._acc_min_distance = 10.0          # Minimum safe distance in meters
self._acc_brake_factor = 0.0           # Current brake intensity (0.0-1.0)
self._acc_previous_obstacle_distance   # For smoothing calculations
```

### Key Methods Added

#### `_apply_adaptive_cruise_control(self, world)`
Main ACC logic that:
1. Gets current vehicle speed
2. Detects closest obstacles ahead
3. Calculates appropriate throttle/brake values
4. Applies smooth control transitions

#### `_get_closest_obstacle_distance(self, world)`
Multi-method obstacle detection:
1. Primary: Uses `ObstacleDetectionSensor` history
2. Fallback: Manual vehicle scanning with geometric calculations
3. Forward-facing cone detection using dot products

#### `_calculate_brake_intensity(self, distance, speed)`
Emergency braking calculation based on:
- Distance to obstacle
- Current vehicle speed
- Progressive brake force application

#### `_calculate_gradual_brake_intensity(self, distance, speed)`
Smooth deceleration calculation for:
- Approaching obstacles
- Speed regulation
- Comfortable ride experience

## Safety Features

### 1. **Manual Override**
- Any manual brake input (S key) immediately disables ACC
- Manual steering remains fully functional
- Throttle input (W key) is ignored when ACC is active

### 2. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**
- Large default distance if obstacle detection fails
- Exception handling in distance calculations
- Minimum/maximum speed limits
- Progressive brake force limits

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- Immediate notification when ACC state changes
- Emergency braking alerts
- Target speed adjustment confirmations
- Real-time status in HUD

## Control Logic

### Speed Maintenance
```
Current Speed < Target - 2 km/h  → Accelerate (throttle: 0.0-0.6)
Current Speed > Target + 2 km/h  → Gentle brake (brake: 0.0-0.3)
Within ±2 km/h of target        → Maintain (throttle: 0.2)
```

### Obstacle Response
```
Distance < 10m   → Emergency brake (0.4-1.0)
Distance < 20m   → Gradual brake (0.0-0.6)
Distance > 20m   → Normal speed control
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Activate ACC**: Press 'J' while driving
2. **Adjust Speed**: Use '+' and '-' keys to modify target speed
3. **Deactivate**: Press 'J' again or apply manual brake with 'S'
4. **Monitor Status**: Check HUD for real-time ACC information

## Code Integration Points

### Key Integration Areas

1. **KeyboardControl class**: Added ACC state management and input handling
2. **HUD class**: Enhanced to display ACC status and information
3. **Game loop**: Modified to pass controller reference to HUD
4. **Help text**: Updated with new key bindings

### Dependencies Used

- Existing `ObstacleDetectionSensor` class
- CARLA vehicle physics and control systems
- Pygame input handling
- Mathematical calculations for geometry and physics

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Toggle ACC on/off
   - Speed adjustment with +/- keys
   - Manual override with brake

2. **Obstacle Detection**:
   - Test with stationary vehicles ahead
   - Test with moving vehicles
   - Test emergency braking scenarios

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Very slow speeds (< 20 km/h)
   - High speeds (> 100 km/h)
   - Sharp turns with obstacles
   - Multiple obstacles in detection range

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Features**:
   - Following distance adjustment
   - Curve speed adaptation
   - Weather-based speed limits
   - Lane-keeping assistance integration

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Sensor fusion improvements
   - Predictive braking algorithms
   - Smoother acceleration curves
   - Better obstacle classification

3. **Safety Improvements**:
   - Multi-sensor redundancy
   - Collision prediction algorithms
   - Driver attention monitoring
   - Emergency stop protocols

This implementation provides a solid foundation for adaptive cruise control in CARLA while maintaining compatibility with existing manual control functionality.
