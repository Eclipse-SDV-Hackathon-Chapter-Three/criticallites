echo "✅ ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:"
echo "==============================="
echo ""
echo "🐛 Issue 1: Q key logic was backwards"
echo "   - Problem: Used 'if self._control.reverse' instead of checking current gear"
echo "   - Fixed: Now checks 'if self._control.gear >= 0' to toggle properly"
echo ""
echo "🐛 Issue 2: Automatic gear reset was overriding reverse"
echo "   - Problem: Line 304 always reset gear to 1 when brake not pressed"
echo "   - Fixed: Only reset gear to 1 if currently in neutral (gear == 0)"
echo ""
echo "🐛 Issue 3: No debugging information for reverse gear"
echo "   - Problem: Hard to diagnose reverse gear issues"
echo "   - Fixed: Added logging for GEAR_CHANGE and REVERSE_THROTTLE events"

# Check fix 3: Debug logging

echo "✅ HOW TO TEST THE FIXES:"
echo "========================"
echo ""
echo "🎮 Manual Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Run: just run-jaccus"
echo "2. Press 'P' to disable autopilot (CRITICAL - otherwise agent overrides your input)"
echo "3. Press 'Q' - you should see 'Reverse On (Gear: 1→-1)'"
echo "4. Press 'W' - vehicle should move BACKWARD"
echo "5. Press 'Q' again - you should see 'Reverse Off (Gear: -1→1)'"
echo "6. Press 'W' - vehicle should move FORWARD"
echo ""
echo "📝 Check the log file 'jaccus_run.log' for:"
echo "   - GEAR_CHANGE entries when pressing Q"
echo "   - REVERSE_THROTTLE entries when pressing W in reverse"
echo ""

echo "🚀 TECHNICAL DETAILS:"
echo "===================="
echo ""
echo "Modified file: targets/jaccus/input/keyboard_handler.py"
echo ""
echo "Changes made:"
echo "1. Line ~136: Fixed Q key toggle logic"
echo "   OLD: self._control.gear = 1 if self._control.reverse else -1"
echo "   NEW: self._control.gear = -1 if self._control.gear >= 0 else 1"
echo ""
echo "2. Line ~304: Prevented automatic gear reset override"
echo "   OLD: self._control.gear = 1"
echo "   NEW: if self._control.gear == 0: self._control.gear = 1"
echo ""
echo "3. Added comprehensive logging for debugging"
echo "   - GEAR_CHANGE logs when Q is pressed"
echo "   - REVERSE_THROTTLE logs when W is pressed in reverse"
echo ""

echo "✅ REVERSE GEAR FIXES COMPLETE!"
echo "=============================="
echo ""
echo "The reverse gear should now work correctly:"
echo "• Press Q to toggle between forward (gear=1) and reverse (gear=-1)"
echo "• Press W to apply throttle in the current gear direction"
echo "• Vehicle will move backward when in reverse gear (gear=-1)"
echo "• Vehicle will move forward when in forward gear (gear=1)"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Remember: Always disable autopilot (P key) before testing manual controls!"
