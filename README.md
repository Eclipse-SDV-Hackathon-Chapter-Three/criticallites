## Challenge  
We have chosen the SDV Lab Challenge.

## Core Idea  
Our idea is to start with a simple concept which will be further improved. JACCUS (Just Another Cruise Control Utility System) will be our solution to this. 
We'll start cruise control who will allow to keep speed but also lowering the energy consumption. By increasing slightly the speed on the descends and lowering a bit when going uphill, it will allow to use inertia in our favor. This may use visual cues, absolute position sensors, gps coordinates, depending on the sensors. 
After that, we intend that it will also keep the vehicle on its lane, so that in a highway we may simply apply it and it will keep going down the road. If it reaches an exit, it will warn in advance the driver. By default, it will keep going. As we advance, we are also considering the hypothesis of doing overtakes or letting JACCUS to choose the lane more appropriate to the drivers chosen speed.

# 2. How Do You Work

## Development Process  
We start by gaining some experience with the tools, knowing and understanding the basic tools. Some of us use Windows, some Linux based OS. After that, we set goals, separated by individuals or small sub-teams. We'll try to split the tasks in smaller ones that can be done in parallel, so we can have a good advance. We don't intend to go fast, but steady, not having to redo code. 

### Planning & Tracking  
We have a main smaller goal, to make sure that everyone on the team gains experience on the tools, but also some stretch goals which we'll adapt according to the available time and advantages.

### Quality Assurance  
Despite being a prototype, everything that can be tested will be tested. The reviews will require for at least 2 members to check the code and to make sure that it works, and that it has proper tests. We probably won't have time to implement a complete CI nor automated system, so, we'll rely on testing as much as we can and take note on those conditions.

## Communication  
We intend to communicate by simply approaching the team. We have hourly updates so that everyone knows the status.

## Decision Making  
Our objective is to work as a team, and to do the decisions where all the elements agree with the solution. More than having a vote or someone choosing, we prefer that all of us do agree with the solution, so that we all reach a same level of involvement.
